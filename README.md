# ReallyBlock

Discord's blocking is strange - it still shows you when someone you've blocked posts a message or thread, and lets you click to read it. If you'd rather not see activity from users you've blocked at all, this extension is for you.

## Installation

- Go to Chrome Settings => extensions
- Turn on Developer mode (top right)
- Click "load unpacked"
- Choose the folder that ReallyBlock is in
